        Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language
         with dynamic semantics developed by Guido van Rossum. It was originally
          released in 1991. Designed to be easy as well as fun, the name
           "Python" is a nod to the British comedy group Monty Python.
      </p>

      <p>
        Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing
        and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development,
        as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing
        components together. Python's standard library supports many things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          HTML and XML
        </li>
        <li>
          JSON
        </li>
        <li>FTP,HTTP, IMAP, SSH2, easy-to-use socket interface</li>

    <header>Python 2 and Python 3</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        Programming communities appreciate Python for its general-purpose
        functionality. Despite not being around for too long, the open-source
        language has evolved into an efficient, readable language meant to
        streamline the web development process. This evolution has taken Python
        through multiple versions, including the two most recent, Python 2 and Python 3.
      </p>

      <p>
      Python 2 and Python 3 have a few key distinctions. Syntax is the major one,
      like with the print function. Print “hello” in Python 2 becomes print
      (“hello”) in Python 3. While the addition of some parentheses doesn’t seem
      too significant, in this context, it changes print from a statement to a
      function. Python 3 has clear, existing commands already built into the code,
      making it very user-friendly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The type of default text strings is another difference. Python 2 uses
         ASCII—a method of encoding English characters with an assigned number.
          While functional, ASCII remains 7-bit, meaning it does not encompass a
          broad range of symbols. On the other hand, Python 3 uses Unicode, which
          is the practical UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format – 8-bit).
          This gives it the ability to represent foreign languages and other widely
           used symbols and emojis.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for libraries, Python 2 is not forwards-compatible like Python 3 is.
        Not only does this incompatibility prevent the usage of Python 2 for newer
         versions, but it also complicates the process of porting Python 2 libraries
          to Python 3. If you are just starting at Python, this isn’t something to
          worry about just yet. Porting is left for more advanced programmers.
          Python 3’s libraries are backward-incompatible, so the language is
          geared towards future improvements.
      </p>
      <p>
        This guide will be using Python 3.

  <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
    <header>Hello world</header>
    <article>
      To get started with writing Python, open your IDE and write your
      first "Hello world" Python code:
      <code>print("Hello World!")
      </code>

      Save and run, and watch your program output "Hello World"!
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
    <header>Variables</header>
    <article>
    <p>
      You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The
      names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules. A variable
      is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
    </p>
    <code> x = 5 </code>
    <p>
      Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can
       even change type after they have been set.
    </p>
    <code> x = 4
          x = "sally"
    </code>
    <p>
      If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
    </p>
    <code> x = str(3) #x will be '3' instead of 3</code>
    <p>Variable names are case-sensitive.</p>
    <code>a = 4
      A = "Sally"
      # A will not overwrite a
    </code>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="data_types">
    <header>Data Types</header>
    <article>
      You can declare a variable in three ways:
      <p>In programming, data type is an important concept. Variables can
        store data of different types, and different types can do different things.
        Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:</p>
        <pre>
Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview</pre>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Casting">
    <header>Casting</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable.
        This can be done with casting. Python is an object-orientated language,
        and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.
      </p>
      <p>Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float
          literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal
          (providing the string represents a whole number)</li>
        <li>float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float
          literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)</li>
        <li>str() - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types,
          including strings, integer literals and float literals</li>
      </ul>
      <code>x = int(1)   # x will be 1
y = int(2.8) # y will be 2
z = int("3") # z will be 3</code>

    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Strings">
    <header>Strings</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
        'hello' is the same as "hello".
        You can display a string literal with the print() function:
      </p>
      <code>print("Hello")
print('Hello')</code>
      <p>
        Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:
      </p>
      <code>a = "Hello"
print(a)</code>
      <p>To get the length of a string, use the len() function.</p>
      <code>a = "Hello, World!"
print(len(a))</code>
      <p>You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax. Specify
        the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.</p>
      <code>b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:5])</code>
      <p>The format() method takes the passed arguments, formats them, and places
        them in the string where the placeholders {} are:</p>
      <code>age = 36
txt = "My name is John, and I am {}"
print(txt.format(age))</code>

    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Boolean">
    <header>Boolean Values</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False.

You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False.

When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer:
      </p>

      <code>print(10 > 9) #true
print(10 == 9) #false</code>
      <p>
        When you run a condition in an if statement, Python returns True or False:
      </p>
      <code>if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
else:
  print("b is not greater than a")</code>
      <p>
        The bool() function allows you to evaluate any value, and give you True or False in return,
      </p>

      <p>
        Almost any value is evaluated to True if it has some sort of content.

Any string is True, except empty strings.

Any number is True, except 0.

Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are True, except empty ones.  The following
will return True:
      </p>

      <code>bool("abc")
bool(123)
bool(["apple", "cherry", "banana"])</code>
      <p>Python also has many built-in functions that return a boolean value,
        like the isinstance() function, which can be used to determine if an object is of a certain data type:
</p>
      <code>x = 200
print(isinstance(x, int))</code>

  <section class="main-section" id="Lists">
    <header>Lists</header>
    <article>
      <p>Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.</p>
      <p>Lists are created using square brackets:</p>
      <code>mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]</code>
      <p>List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.</p>
      <code>thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist[1]) #prints "banana"</code>
      <p>You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range.</p>
      <p>When specifying a range, the return value will be a new list with the specified items.</p>
      <code>thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[2:5])</code>
      <p>To change the value of a specific item, refer to the index number:</p>
      <code>thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist[1] = "blackcurrant"</code>
      <p>To insert a new list item, without replacing any of the existing values, we can use the insert() method.</p>
      <code>thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.insert(2, "watermelon")</code>
      <p>To add an item to the end of the list, use the append() method:</p>
      <code>thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.append("orange")</code>
      <p>The remove() method removes the specified item.</p>
      <code>thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.remove("banana")</code>

    <article>
      <p>Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.</p>

      <p>Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections
         of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.</p>

      <p>A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.</p>

      <p>Tuples are written with round brackets. To create a tuple:</p>
      <code>thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")</code>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Dictionaries">
    <header>Dictionaries</header>
    <article>
      <p>Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.</p>
      <code>thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}</code>

  <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
    <header>if...else statement</header>
    <article>
      <p>Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Equals:<code> a == b </code>
Not Equals:<code> a != b</code>
Less than:<code> a < b</code>
Less than or equal to:<code> a <= b</code>
Greater than:<code> a > b</code>
Greater than or equal to:<code> a >= b</code>
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.</p>

      <code>a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")</code>
  <p>The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.</p>
  <code>a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")</code>

  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
    <header>while statement</header>
    <article>
      A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition
      evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

      <code>i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1</code> If the condition becomes false,
      statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
      statement following the loop.

      <p>
        The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
        the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
        tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
        control is passed to the statement following while.
